I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
I spend the day your way
Call it morning driving thru the sound and in and out the valley

The music dance and sing
They make the children really ring
I spend the day your way
Call it morning driving thru the sound and in and out the valley

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be there with you

I will remember you
Your silhouette will charge the view
Of distance atmosphere
Call it morning driving thru the sound and even in the valley

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be there with you

Along the drifting cloud the eagle searching down on the land
Catching the swirling wind the sailor sees the rim of the land
The eagle's dancing wings create as weather spins out of hand

Go closer hold the land feel partly no more than grains of sand
We stand to lose all time a thousand answers by in our hand
Next to your deeper fears we stand surrounded by a million years

I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
Twenty four before my love and I'll be there

I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
You spend the day your way
Call it morning driving thru the sound and in and out the valley

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be there with you

		<p id="hidden_text" class="hidden_text"> Wow! Wasn't that <em> magical</em>? This text just appeared out of thin air! JavaScript really is pretty rad...it seems I wasn't entirely truthful with you before, though. There was something hiding from you, right before your very eyes...</p>

	</h3> <!--I like the look of all of this being h3 but also <p>, dunno why things break when I turn it off though...to figure this out later!-->


		<h1 id="structure"> Alright, let's get some dang structure in here, so I don't lose myself in this madness.</h1>

		<hr>

		<h2 id="html"> HTML </h2>

		<p> HTML is the skeleton of things. </p>

		<hr>

		<h3 id="paragraphs"> Paragraphs </h3>

		<p> This here is your standard paragraph. It's pretty nifty, if I do say so myself, and most text on a site will be displayed using this here fella. </p>

		<p> This one is prestructured, like a poem. It maintains the way I type it, without unique spacing or line breaks. So I could, like, tell you a poem or something.
		</p>

		<pre>
			<q>Roses are red,
			Violets are blue,
			Butts.</q>
				~Zack
		</pre>

		<p> And I guess "q" is for when you're too lazy to put in some quotes?<br><br>I already sort of played with the others above, so uh...on with the show! </p>

		<div class="split">
			<p>
				Detour! I decided to test out dividers with different styles. Verdict so far? <span style="color:red;"> Pretty handy, eh? </span>
			</p>
		</div>

		<hr>

		<h3 id="links"> Links </h3>

		<p> Links are pretty radical, but you gotta make sure your links do the right thing. </p>

		<a href="butts.html" target="_blank"> Butts (New Tab)</a>
		<br>
		<a href="butts.html" target="_self"> Butts (This Tab)</a>
		<br>
		<a href="butts.html" target="_parent"> Butts (Parent)</a> <!--???-->
		<br>
		<a href="butts.html" target="_top"> Butts (New Window)</a>

		<p> Images? Those things can also be links! </p>
		<a href="butts.html"><img src="http://www.officialpsds.com/images/thumbs/Vector-Rainbow-psd34813.png" width="261px" height="400px" alt="Butts"></a>

		<hr>

		<h3 id="tables"> Tables </h3>

		<p> I already also did some table stuff, and it's pretty lame. Sorry, HTML, CSS, I'm like...not huge on tables. But I'll make some anyways! </p>

		<table id="t01">
			<caption> Butts! </caption>
			<tr>
				<th>Memes</th>
				<th>Are</th>
				<th>Dreams</th>
				<th>???</th>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td>¿¿¿</td>

		<h3 id="lists"> Lists </h3>

		<p> I mean, we're really scraping the bottom of the barrel at this point...but damn it, have some lists! <br><br> Okay, I'mma be real with you, I already did a bunch of lists above, I have like 0% motivation to make more. Rapid fire lists! </p>

		<ul style="list-style-type:square">
			<li> List Thing! </li>
			<li> More List Thing! </li>
			<li> Moral? Square Bullets! </li>

		<h3 id="iframes"> IFrames </h3>

		<p> The end goal is in sight, my dude. We're almost done with HTML, thank the actual lord at this point, argh! Final step? IFrames! </p>

		<iframe src="butts.html" width="300" height="300" style="border:2px solid black;"></iframe>

		<p id="date"> Wanna see another magic trick? </p>

		<p style="display: none;" id='hidden'> Boom! Today's date! </p>


		<h2 id="css"> CSS </h2>

		<hr>


		<h3 id="borders"> Borders </h3>

		<p class="dotted"> CSS is pretty rad. I can have neat borders, and stuff. This thing? Dotted border </p>
		<p class="mixdotted"> But this one? Mix dotted/dashed! And weird thicknesses. And it's ~colorful~ </p>
		<p style="border-style: double;">Those ones used classes to define things, but this one just uses an inline style.</p>
		<p style="border-style: inset;"> Remember: Border Style MUST BE DEFINED if you want to mess with other border-y things (like width/color). And order goes TOP, RIGHT, BOTTOM, LEFT (TRBL) </p>

		<p style="border-style: solid;"> And if TB/RL should be =, 2 values is fine instead of four. Only four if all need their own specifications! </p>

		<p class="informhighlight"> Did you know? Butts! </p>


		<h3 id="classes"> Classes </h3>

		<p class="obj"> This thing has the class 'obj' </p>
		<small class="obj"> So does this (even though it's tiny) </small>
		<p class="obj"> However, paragraphs with this class are defined to be gray in CSS... </p>
		<small class="obj"> While small text? Emerald green. </small>
		<p class="rainbow obj"> And even though this IS a paragraph, it's also defined to be a member of the 'cen' class...which is centered. Two classes at once! Take that, C++</p>
